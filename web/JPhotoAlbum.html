<p>JPhotoAlbum is a Java desktop application for
quickly browsing, organizing and commenting digital photographs and
publishing the resulting albums as web pages. Albums are saved in XML
formatted files which are transformed to HTML with XML stylesheets.

<p>The photos in <a href="http://photos.jpkware.com/">photos.jpkware.com</a>
have been organized and published using this program.

<p><b>January 2020 Update: world has changed, the old app was was not
    compatible with new Java. The updated sources compatible
    with Java 8 and 11 are available in
    <a href="https://github.com/jkarjala/jphotoalbum">github</a>.<br/>
    You can download the latest <a href="jph-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar">full jar</a> and run it with
    java (double clicking the jar should work on windows).
</b></p>

<p> See the Help/Contents in the program menu to get started with the
program!</p>

Ask user what to do first when starting the program without an album name on command line.

</li>

<li>1.2.3 Fixed a few additional bugs in album linking and loading.
Reordered page menu. Fixed non-black-and-white foreground and background
colors, changed default colors to be black on a bit yellowish white.

next/previous links and colors on image frame, and the frame is also
generated with a stylesheet.

the slow (sometimes VERY slow) getScaledInstance() method. Added 
"Find original photos".
</li>
<li>1.1.7 Subtitled images are named "albumnameNNN.ext" where the NNN
is the index of the photo in the album. This way they are shown in
album order even if the player reorders them by file name. Added
text elements without an image.

panel works, too.
</li>

</li>
<li>1.1.4 Show full path in status line. Enter/double click on photo
shows it in a full screen view. "show" command line option added.

a few missing dispose() calls. Keep small images in normal size in
full screen view. Handle GIFs correctly, and accept them from drops,
too.
</li>
<li>1.1.3 Load thumbs in a background thread, also generate thumbs for
files without Exif info. Show description (if defined) in thumbnail
instead of file name. Remember JPG import directory during one session.
</li>
